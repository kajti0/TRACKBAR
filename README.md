# TRACKBAR
A web app project, basically for tracking your tasks. 
It allows you to create, edit and delete tasks, you can 
also invite other members to cooperate with you. It has two basic 
views - main page, where you can see all your tasks listed
and the weather for next couple of days, and a calendar, which 
allows you to see when are your events gonna happen. 
Written using JavaScript and HTML on frontend, and PHP 8.3 with 
a PostgreSQL database on backend.
